# The-Stream-Button
This is a java program which opens a timer and a button. The timer will go down until it reaches zero or you push the button (or the close button). If it reaches zero, your computer will shut down, so you have to keep clicking the button to reset the timer. There is a safe version for download which just closes itself when the timer reaches zero.
